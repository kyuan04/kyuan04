Hi, I’m Kevin! I’m a college junior studying computer science at UCLA with an expected graduation of June 2025. I love building applications and creating software that provide value and target issues to make things more accessible and convenient. I'm currently seeking internship experience. Feel free to reach me at kevinyuan04@gmail.com for any inquiries or opportunities!
